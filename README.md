# Internal-Audit-Dashboard
The Internal Audit project contain two dashboard provides a comprehensive view of audit-related insights, allowing stakeholders to understand risks, audit outcomes, and departmental responsibilities. Here's a breakdown of its components:

**Expense Analysis Dashboard Overview:**

The Expense Analysis Dashboard offers a detailed examination of expenditure data, providing insights into spending patterns across various dimensions. Here's an overview of its key components:

**Slicers for Filtering:**
The dashboard features seven slicers for fine-grained data filtering. Users can narrow down the analysis based on Department, Employee Name, Employee Country, Spend Category, Approval Status, Quarter of Transaction Date, and Transaction Date. These slicers empower users to explore specific segments of expenditure data according to their preferences and requirements.

**Decomposition Tree Visual:**
The Decomposition Tree visualization offers a hierarchical breakdown of spending. In the "Analyse" section, it presents the total sum of actual spending, providing an overview of overall expenditure. Meanwhile, the "Explain By" section delves into the factors influencing spending, including Employee Country, Department, Employee Name, and Expense Type. This visualization facilitates a deeper understanding of spending dynamics and helps identify contributing factors behind expenditure trends.

**Stacked Bar Chart**:
A stacked bar chart is utilized to illustrate spending distribution by expense type. The y-axis represents different expense types, while the x-axis displays the total sum of actual spending. Additionally, payment types are represented within the bars, offering insights into how spending is distributed across various expense categories and payment methods.

**Tree Map**:
The Tree Map visualization presents a hierarchical view of spending, categorizing expenditures by Department and Expense Type. Each category is sized based on the sum of actual spending, providing a visual representation of expenditure allocation across different departments and expense types. This allows users to quickly identify departments or expense categories with significant spending and explore detailed expenditure data within these segments.
Through these visualizations, stakeholders can gain a comprehensive understanding of expenditure patterns, identify trends, and make informed decisions regarding budget allocation, expense management, and resource optimization. The dashboard's interactive features and robust visualizations empower users to perform in-depth analysis and extract actionable insights from the expenditure data.


**Internal Audit Dashboard**

 **Slicers for Filtering:**
Users can customize the dashboard using slicers for Cities, Department, Risk Type, and Year. These slicers enable precise data filtering, offering a focused analysis based on specific criteria.
**Donut Charts:**

**Risk Rating by Audit Manager**: This chart visualizes the distribution of risk ratings as assessed by audit managers. It displays risk types, assigned audit managers, and the total sum of risk ratings, providing insights into risk assessment patterns.

**Audit Outcome Overview**: Another donut chart illustrates audit outcomes categorized by risk type. It helps in understanding the distribution of audit results and their correlation with different risk types.

**Stacked Column Chart**:
This chart correlates responsibilities with the sum of risk ratings, segmented by risk types. By mapping responsibilities against risk assessments, it offers a clear understanding of where risks are concentrated within the organization.

**Tree Map**:
The Tree Map visualization presents a hierarchical view of risks, responsibilities, and departments. It allows users to delve into specific risk types associated with different responsibilities across departments, providing a nuanced understanding of risk distribution.

**Stacked Bar Chart**:
This chart depicts department-wise risk assessments, with risk types categorized in the legend. By visualizing risk exposure across departments, stakeholders can identify areas requiring heightened attention or mitigation strategies.

**Filled Map**:
Geographical insights are provided through a filled map showcasing cities where audits have been conducted. Risk ratings are represented in the legend, with latitude and longitude markers for spatial analysis. Additionally, departmental details are available in tooltips for further context.
By leveraging these visualizations, stakeholders can gain valuable insights into audit-related data, enabling informed decision-making, risk management, and strategic planning. The dashboard's interactive features and intuitive design facilitate a dynamic exploration of audit metrics tailored to specific needs and preferences.
